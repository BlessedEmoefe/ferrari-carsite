                  Built in 1947, the 125 S was the very first car to wear the
                  Ferrari name. Under its long hood lived a 1.5-liter V12 engine
                  that sent 118 horsepower to the rear wheels via a five-speed
                  manual transmission, jaw-dropping statistics at the time.
                  While it dropped out of its first race, it helped Ferrari
                  secure its first victory during the 1947 edition of the Grand
                  Prix of Rome.

                  The F40 was developed to celebrate the brand’s 40th
                  anniversary. It made extensive use of composite materials,
                  which was highly impressive at the time, and it offered a
                  stripped-down interior that made occupants feel like they were
                  traveling aboard a Le Mans prototype. The sharp, low-slung
                  look has earned the F40 the distinction of being one of
                  Ferrari’s most recognizable designs.

                  The Challenge Stradale offered enthusiasts genuine race
                  car-like performance and features in an accessible,
                  street-legal package. Starting with the 360 Modena, Ferrari
                  engineers removed all equipment deemed superfluous in order to
                  shed weight, lowered and stiffened the suspension, and fitted
                  massive alloy wheels. Inside, the two passengers were treated
                  to bucket seats with racing harnesses and Plexiglas windows.

                  You know a car is going to be a big deal when it’s named after
                  the company’s founder. It’s the kind of homage a brand can
                  only pull off once if it wants to retain its credibility.
                  Luckily, the limited-edition Ferrari Enzo lived up to the
                  hype. In the early 2000s, Ferrari’s dominance of the hypercar
                  market was under attack by Porsche, Lamborghini, and
                  Mercedes-Benz. The Enzo had to beat the competition and make a
                  bigger splash than the F50.

                  The LaFerrari was the latest in a long line of high-tech,
                  face-meltingly fast hypercars built by Ferrari. Its name means
                  “the Ferrari” in Italian, and it took the company forward by
                  introducing new technology previously seen only on prototypes,
                  concepts, or race cars. Notably, it was the first street-legal
                  hybrid produced by Ferrari.

                  At its launch, the FXX was the most technologically-advanced
                  Ferrari by a long shot. It was a more extreme evolution of the
                  Enzo developed with input from star Formula 1 pilots like
                  Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello. It came equipped
                  with a 6.3-liter V12 engine that sent a whopping 800 hp to the
                  rear wheels through an F1-derived automatic transmission.

                  The 488 GTB opened a new chapter in the history of Ferrari’s
                  V8-powered, mid-engined machines. Born from the 458 Italia,
                  the 488 received a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 engine that
                  made 661 hp at a screaming 8,000 rpm and 561 pound-feet of
                  torque at 3,000 rpm. It boasts 169.4 hp per liter of
                  displacement, a record for a road-going Ferrari. Floor it and
                  you’re at 60 mph in about three seconds.

                  You’re probably thinking, “Why the long face?” First, because
                  the Colani Ferrari Testa d’Oro was designed in 1989, and this
                  was precisely what the car of the future looked like at the
                  time. Second, this wasn’t just another mundane supercar. It
                  was envisioned as a Ferrari capable of setting speed records
                  on Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats. The car wasn’t actually
                  designed by Ferrari, though the brand played a part in making
                  it a reality.

                  Unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Auto Show, the Pininfarina Sergio
                  concept paid homage to the company founder’s son, whose name
                  was Sergio. He took over Pininfarina after his father,
                  Battista, died in 1966. He is responsible for numerous designs
                  including the Ferrari F40, the Fiat Dino, and the Peugeot 504
                  coupe/convertible. He also helped draw the Ferrari 360.
